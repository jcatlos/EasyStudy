To download the dataset, visit https://github.com/mdeff/fma repository and download the fma_metadata.zip dataset. 
From that you are going to need `tracks.csv`, `genres.csv`, and `echonest.csv`,
which should be copied into this folder.

Then, unzip the folder `img.7z` to subfolder `img` (so you have `..fma/img/__.jpg` structure).
